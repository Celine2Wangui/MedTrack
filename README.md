MedTrack
A Simple Medication Reminder

MedTrack is a basic web application designed to help users keep track of their medication schedules. It provides a user-friendly interface to input medication details, including name, dosage, schedule, start date, and end date.

To Use:

Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/MedTrack.git
Use code with caution.

Open the index.html file: This will launch the application in your web browser.
Input Medication Details: Fill in the required fields and click the "Add Medication" button.
View Medication List: Your added medications will be displayed in a list.
Future Enhancements:

While this is a basic version, I plan to expand MedTrack with features like:

Reminder Notifications: Receive timely reminders for medication intake.
Data Persistence: Store medication data locally or in a database.
User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts and securely store their medication information.
Drug Interaction Checker: Integrate with a drug interaction database.
Refill Reminders: Get alerts for medication refills.
We encourage contributions to enhance MedTrack and make it a more robust tool for medication management.
